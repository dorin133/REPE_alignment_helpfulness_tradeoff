The sum of all the integers in the list, computed using the `sum` function.\n2. The product of all the integers in the list, computed using the `product` function.\n\nThe function handles empty lists by returning a tuple with `0` as the sum and `1` as the product.\n\nHere are some sample calls to the function to demonstrate its behavior:\n\n```\n>>> sum_product([])\n(0, 1)\n\n>>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])\n(10, 24)\n```\n\nI hope this helps!

We define the function `below_zero` with a parameter `operations` which is a list of integers representing deposit and withdrawal operations.\n2. We initialize the balance of the account to 0.\n3. We loop through each operation in the `operations` list, and check if it is positive or negative.\n4. If the operation is positive, we add it to the balance. If it is negative, we subtract it from the balance.\n5. We check if the balance is less than 0 at any point during the loop.

If all operations result in a positive balance, the function returns `False`.\n\nHere are some examples of the function in action:\n\n>>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])\nFalse\n>>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])\nTrue\n\nI hope this helps!

We initialize an empty list `operations` to store the deposit and withdrawal operations.\n2. We initialize a variable `balance` to 0, which will represent the current balance of the bank account.\n3. We loop through the list of operations, and for each operation, we check if it is positive or negative.\n4. If the operation is positive, we add it to the `balance` variable. If the operation is negative, we subtract it from the `balance` variable.\n5. After we loop through all the operations, we check if the `balance` variable is less than 0.

Here is the correct implementation of the `filter_by_substring` function:\n\n```\ndef filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:\n    return [string for string in strings if substring in string]\n```\n\nThe function takes two arguments: `strings`, a list of strings, and `substring`, a substring to search for. It returns a new list of strings that contain the given substring.\n\nHere's an example of how the function would work:\n```\nfilter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')\n```\nThis would return the list `['abc', 'bacd', 'array']`.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with!", "  Sure, I'd be happy to help!
